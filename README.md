# Modora â€“ E-commerce Furniture Store

Modora is a fully responsive and mobile-friendly e-commerce demo store built using React and Redux Toolkit. It showcases modern frontend development practices, including authentication, protected routes, state management, and integration with Supabase for backend services. Users can register, sign in, manage their wishlist, view order history, and browse products through a highly optimized and user-friendly interface.
